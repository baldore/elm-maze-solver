# Maze Solver

Create your own maze and see what is the shortest path.

## Experience

I learned a lot of this project. I was able to apply so many things about functional programming.
Also, Elm is incredible. The hardest part was to think about the tests and how to solve the problem
using functional programming.

However, the actual code was easy to write and (at least for me) looks extremely clean. I expect
Elm to keep growing and I'll be looking forward to see what else will come for this great technology.

## TODO

-[x] Read the article and (hopefully) understand the algorithm.
-[x] Implement the algorithm.
-[ ] Add error messages for
  - Missing Start/End cell.
  - Maze is not solvable.
  Also, show an error message that should disappear after some time.
-[ ] Create Github page to see the maze solver working.

## Thanks

This project is powered by [moarwick/elm-webpack-starter](https://github.com/moarwick/elm-webpack-starter)
and the awesome Elm language, of course :)

The solution was taken from https://www.codeproject.com/articles/9040/maze-solver-shortest-path-finder. Very
good explanation.
